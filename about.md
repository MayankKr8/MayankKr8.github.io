<p>Hello! I am Mayank Kumar.</p>
<p>I am a 2020 passout from department of  <a href='https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse'>Computer Science and Engineering</a>, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi, having successfully completed an Integrated Dual Degree(B.Tech & M.Tech) program. I am interested and have working experience in fields like blockchains, game-theory, cloud computing, IoT, homomorphic encryption. I have been working for more than 2 years in the software development, and am looking forward to a lot more, unless ofcourse I suddenly inherit a boatload of money.</p>

<p>I have been to places and love travelling. Contrary to popular opinion, I prefer beaches to mountains. I am a huge movie/series buff. <a href = 'https://www.imdb.com/user/ur90842608/ratings'>These</a> are the titles I have watched. I have recently started <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/97212341-mayank-kumar'>reading</a>. I have started with the obvious suggestions, but do give me a recommendation if you think it's worth the heed.</p>
